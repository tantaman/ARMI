Enable passing of connected client to the server so
we can facilitate 2-way comms that aren't just via
return values.
Make completion callbacks optional
Push up everything but conn logic to a common base (to facilitate bi-di comms)

Make a custom serialization protocol so re-serialization of the user-serialized data
doesn't incur any overhead.
